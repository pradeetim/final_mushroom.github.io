(sl5454), Polly Wu (rw3031), Shizhe Zhang (sz3214), Yan Li (yl5505)

**Tentative Project Title**: No Zombie Apocolypse Here: Exploring
Mushrooms

**Motivation for this project**: With an increase in people who forage
for mushrooms, we want to explore this data set to see if there are any
striking characteristics of mushrooms that can be used to determine if
they are poisonous or edible.

**Intended final products**:

- Website describing the data set and our regression results; a screen
  cast of our website.
- A written report that details how we complete our project.

**Anticipated data sources**: [Mushroom dataset from UC
Irvine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)

This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples
corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and
Lepiota Family (pp.Â 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely
edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not
recommended.

**Planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges**:

- *Planned Analyses*:
  - Baseline characteristics comparison for mushrooms categorized as
    poisonous or edible
  - Univariate regression for how each feature (cap_shape, cap_surface,
    cap_color, bruises, etc. ) is associated with poisonous
  - Multivariate regression model for predicting whether a mushroom is
    poisonous
- *Visualizations*: Hexbin plot to show the number distribution of
  classes/habitats v.s. color (cap/stalk/veil/spore).
- *Coding challenges*: picking co-variates for the multivariate model

**Planned timeline**:

- November 8th: Submit the Proposal
- November 11-15: Project review meeting
- Nov 17: Finalizing plans and starting work (Internal deadline).
- Nov 24: Webpage work due (internal deadline)
- Dec 1: Screencast recoded and report written (internal deadline). The
  final review of work starts.
- December 7: Report, webpage, and screencast, peer assessment due.
- December 12th: In-class discussion of projects
